        <p>I have played 5 different sports being: Baseball (from age 6), Flag Football (just one year), Soccer (for 2 years),
            Basketball (for 3 years), and Tennis (since middle schools).</p>

        <p>I feel in love with technology in 6th grade. This was my first time having a class that taught students general
            programming knowledge. I got to program a robot which was what made me realize what I wanted to do when I grew
        up.</p>

        <p>I worked at Meijer for 10 months as a cart pusher. I would help out in other areas from time to time.</p>

        <p>My favorite color is blue as you can tell from the website's color scheme.</p>

        <p>I love to learn new things. One thing that I enjoyed learning the most about was Godot. Making my own game,
            Endless Blade, was a lot of fun. I learned a lot about how important hierarchy of how nodes are placed can
            quite literally make or break your game. I still can't figure out why one computer is having graphical issues,
        but everything else is fine.</p>

        my old blackjack game.</p>
